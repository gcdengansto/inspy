Inelastic Neutron Scattering Resolution Calculation Python Package


The package of inspy is a python package to calculate the instrumental resolutions of inelastic neutron scattering instrument, 
including triple=axis spectrometers and time-of-flight spectrometers. This package is developed on the basis of the other resolution 
calculation packages: neutronpy and Reslib3.4c. However, many improvements have been done on the basis of the package neutronpy. 
This package is easy to use in the Jupyter notebook.
